#### Objective
As an aspiring engineering student with a strong foundation in mechanical design, manufacturing, and system optimization, I am passionate about developing innovative, real-world solutions that align with modern trends in consumer product design. With a particular interest in areas such as circular design, design for manufacturing, and IoT integration, I am eager to apply my academic knowledge and hands-on experiences to create technologies that are both efficient and environmentally sustainable. I am driven by the potential of engineering to improve everyday life and excited to contribute to product development teams that prioritize functionality, usability, and forward-thinking design.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy fly fishing and skiing, two activities that connect me to the outdoors and challenge me in different ways. As a ski instructor, I’ve learned the value of tradition, patience, and shared experiences, all of which continue to shape how I approach design thinking and teamwork. I’m excited to further grow my skills and collaborate with professionals who are equally passionate about creating practical, impactful products.
