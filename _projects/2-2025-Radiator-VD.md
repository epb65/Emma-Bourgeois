As part of Entrepreneurship for Engineers class at Cornell University, our team is developing a smart radiator automation control system, tailored for over 2.1 million New York City apartments still reliant on outdated steam heat infrastructure. This direct-to-consumer product combines a motorized valve actuator with a digital thermostat and mobile app interface, giving residents precise temperature control and improved energy efficiency.

We are currently in our first round of prototyping, focusing on hardware reliability, cross-radiator compatibility, and sensor integration. I’ve led the mechanical development using tools such as SolidWorks, Fusion 360, and Arduino, while also using MATLAB and Python to model thermal behavior and evaluate control strategies.

In parallel, we are creating a go-to-market plan targeting an October 2025 launch, which includes early adopter profiling, pricing strategy, and customer acquisition pathways. Our commercialization strategy is supported by ongoing market research and outreach to potential partners, including landlords and property managers in NYC.
