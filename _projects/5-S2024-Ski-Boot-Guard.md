In a semester-long product design course at Cornell, I developed a hands-free ski boot sole guard aimed at extending boot lifespan and improving user safety and convenience. Many skiers face excessive wear on their boot soles from walking on rough terrain, which can compromise binding compatibility and performance. I designed a compact, clip-on solution that protects the sole without requiring manual removal. Using Fusion 360, I explored multiple mechanisms and form factors that prioritize ease of use, traction, and compatibility with common boot types.

To validate the design, I conducted FEA simulations to evaluate material elasticity and structural response under stress, ensuring the guard could withstand cold-weather conditions and repetitive loading. The final prototype balanced flexibility for easy engagement with durability for prolonged outdoor use. Throughout the process, I emphasized iterative prototyping and user feedback to improve the guardâ€™s ergonomics and performance, creating a functional, skier-friendly solution that could reduce industry waste and increase product longevity.
