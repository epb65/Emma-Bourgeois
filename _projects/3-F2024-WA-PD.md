As part of my senior design project at Cornell University, I worked with a cross-functional team to develop a weatherproof hood insert designed to improve the stability and wearability of outerwear in harsh conditions. Our target demographic was college students in places like Ithaca, who often neglect weather protection despite frequent exposure to wind and rain. We conducted research with over 100 users to understand common frustrations—like collapsing hoods and poor fit—and used Fusion 360 and SolidWorks to create multiple design iterations that balanced support, comfort, and packability.

The final design featured a headphone-inspired adjustability mechanism, allowing users to customize fit and tension in real time. Alongside prototyping, we explored direct-to-consumer launch strategies and potential partnerships with outerwear brands, aiming to fill a clear gap in the market for functional, student-friendly weather gear. We presented our work to a panel of 50+ industry professionals, received strong interest, and began filing design and utility patents to protect the product’s innovation.
