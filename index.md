## About Me

Hi! I’m Emma Bourgeois, a Cornell Mechanical Engineering graduate with a designer’s mindset and an instinct for problem-solving. Ever since I was a kid, all I wanted to do was play with Legos and figure out how the world worked. “How It’s Made” was my Sunday morning show,  Home Depot was our second home, and I stole any scraps and parts to build anything my creativity desired. My parents gave me the “I can fix it” mindset early on, and it stuck. By high school, I was diving headfirst into engineering: learning SolidWorks and AutoCAD at 13, 3D printing my first prototypes, and falling in love with the process of turning ideas into real, useful things.

At Cornell University, I took that curiosity and ran with it in the Mechanical Engineering Degree Program. My experience spans product development, system optimization, and hands-on prototyping, all grounded in a human-centered approach to engineering. I’ve designed everything from NASA ChipSat Satellite compositions to structural weatherproof hoods and ski boot protectors, always asking how I can make the world work better for the people in it. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments, where technical rigor meets creative iteration, and where the goal isn’t just to build, but to build something that matters. This portfolio is a reflection of the work that’s shaped me, and the kind of work I’m excited to keep doing: product design that blends sustainability, optimization, and technical excellence.
